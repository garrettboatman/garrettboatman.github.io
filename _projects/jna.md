In 2013, I joined efforts with Christopher Chu and build the 800+ epsiode Script Archive for Jake & Amir. 

This happened because of hundreds of hours spent by /r/jakeandamir redditors transcribing episodes.

After this was all done, I even built a [JnA RESTful API](https://jnapi.gelato.io) for all the episodes. Check out [this twitter bot](https://twitter.com/leron_uh) that uses the API to grab script snippets.
